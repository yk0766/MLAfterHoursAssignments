    "***1.*** ***Bisection Method***\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider linear equations of the form f(x) = mx+ c, where m is the slope of the line and c is the y-intercept.  For convenience, we assume that the domain of the function (the valid values of x) is restricted to some range. The root of an equation is the value of x for which f(x)= 0\n",
    "\n",
    "The bisection method is one of the simplest numerical algorithms to find the root of an equation. Here’s how we proceed. We first find two values of x, say p1 and p2, such that f(p1) <0 and f(p2) >0. This can be done by randomly sampling x from its range. The intuition behind the bisection method is pretty straightforward: if we have two values of x for which the function is less than and greater than zero, then there must be some value of x between these two values for which the function is equal to zero. So we simply calculate (p1+p2)/2 and set either p1 or p2 to this new value, after evaluating the function to check if it is negative or positive for this value. We iterate till  p1=p2, which is the root we seek.\n",

    "In order to get a good handle on it, run this algorithm by hand on an example. \n",

    "For the implementation, here’s how you should proceed:\n",

    "Initial working prototype:\n",
    "Think carefully about the different steps that you need to implement, and write these down.\n",
    "Use this list to decide what functions you should implement.\n",
    "Think about how you will test your implementation.\n",
    "Get to work!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do a lot more in software that is worth exploring! \n",
    "Analysis and enhancements:\n",
    "It may be the case that the exact value of the root cannot be represented by the precision of the machine that we are running on. So the solution may represent a range, rather than a single value.\n",
    "Decide (or ask the user) on a desired precision and iterate till this is achieved.\n",
    "How many steps does it take? What is the accuracy of the latest estimate at each step? How does this reduce?\n",
    "Is there a connection to the parameters of the function? Experiment with this and draw reasonable conclusions, with explanations.\n",
    "A picture is worth a thousand words! Plot the function, your initial guess and updates, showing how the range tightens with each iteration. Also plot the error at each step.\n",
    "Animate the previous step!\n",
    "Repeat for quadratic and other equations.\n"
